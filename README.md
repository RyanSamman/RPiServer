# Raspberry Pi Server

The server I created to establish a websocket between my Raspberry Pi and my browser. I used it in the background of [one of my YouTube videos for CPIT221](https://cpit221.ryansamman.com/#first-task).
In the future, I will be using this code as my starter for my other Raspberry Pi projects to serve as a GUI to control my Raspberry Pi's functionality. 

# Cloud Version
Another version is available [here](https://ryans-socket.herokuapp.com/), which is hosted on Heroku instead.
